# TASK-PRR-007: IRT theta architecturally isolated from student-visible DTOs

**Priority**: P0 — ship-blocker (lens consensus: 4)
**Effort**: M — 1-2 weeks
**Lens consensus**: persona-ministry, persona-redteam, persona-ethics, persona-cogsci
**Source docs**: `AXIS_6_Assessment_Feedback_Research.md:L169`, `cena_competitive_analysis.md:L122`
**Assignee hint**: claude-subagent-theta-isolation
**Tags**: source=pre-release-review-2026-04-20, lens=ministry
**Status**: Not Started
**Source**: Synthesized from 10-persona pre-release review (2026-04-20) — see `/pre-release-review/reviews/SYNTHESIS.md`
**Tier**: mvp

## Goal
Enforce RDY-080 prediction-surface ban as architecture test. Theta/readiness/at-risk never reach student/teacher/parent DTOs. Readiness outputs clamped to ordinal categories.

## Files
- src/contracts/dto/**
- tests/architecture/PredictionSurfaceTests.cs
- ADR on prediction-surface ban

## Definition of Done
- Arch test fails if theta scalar leaks into any outbound DTO; ADR accepted; readiness maps to 4 ordinal buckets.

## Reporting
complete via: node .agentdb/kimi-queue.js complete <id> --worker claude-subagent-theta-isolation --result "<branch>"

## Non-negotiable references
- RDY-080

## Implementation Protocol — Senior Architect

Implementation of this task must be driven by a senior-architect mindset, not a checklist. Before writing any code, the implementer (human or agent) must answer both sets of questions in writing — either in a task-comment, the PR description, or a `docs/decisions/` note:

### Ask why
- **Why does this task exist?** Read the source-doc lines cited above and the persona reviews in `/pre-release-review/reviews/persona-*/` that raised it. If you cannot restate the motivation in one sentence, do not start coding.
- **Why this priority?** Read the lens-consensus list. Understand which persona lens raised it and what evidence they cited.
- **Why these files?** Trace the data flow end-to-end. Verify the files listed are the right seams. A bad seam invalidates the whole task.
- **Why are the non-negotiables above relevant?** Show understanding of how each constrains the solution, not just that they exist.

### Ask how
- **How does this interact with existing aggregates and bounded contexts?** Name them.
- **How does it respect tenant isolation (ADR-0001), event sourcing, the CAS oracle (ADR-0002), and session-scoped misconception data (ADR-0003)?**
- **How will it fail?** What's the runbook at 03:00 on a Bagrut exam morning? If you cannot describe the failure mode, the design is incomplete.
- **How will it be verified end-to-end, with real data?** Not mocks. Query the DB, hit the APIs, compare field names and tenant scoping — see user memory "Verify data E2E" and "Labels match data".
- **How does it honor the <500 LOC per file rule, the no-stubs-in-prod rule, and the full `Cena.Actors.sln` build gate?**

### Before committing
- Full `Cena.Actors.sln` must build cleanly (branch-only builds miss cross-project errors — learned 2026-04-13).
- Tests cover golden path **and** edge cases surfaced in the persona reviews.
- No cosmetic patches over root causes. No "Phase 1 stub → Phase 1b real" pattern (banned 2026-04-11).
- No dark-pattern copy (ship-gate scanner must pass).
- If the task as-scoped is wrong in light of what you find, **push back** and propose the correction via a task comment — do not silently expand scope, shrink scope, or ship a stub.

### If blocked
- Fail loudly: `node .agentdb/kimi-queue.js fail <task-id> --worker <you> --reason "<specific blocker, not 'hard'>"`.
- Do not silently reduce scope. Do not skip a non-negotiable. Do not bypass a hook with `--no-verify`.

### Definition of done is higher than the checklist above
- Labels match data (UI label = API key = DB column intent).
- Root cause fixed, not masked.
- Observability added (metrics, structured logs with tenant/session IDs, runbook entry).
- Related personas' cross-lens handoffs addressed or explicitly deferred with a new task ID.

**Reference**: full protocol and its rationale live in [`/tasks/pre-release-review/README.md`](../../tasks/pre-release-review/README.md#implementation-protocol-senior-architect) (this section is duplicated there for skimming convenience).
